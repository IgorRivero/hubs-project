### NOTES: This project was developed in a Databricks notebook. Then I migrate it to a jupyter notebook. It works both in a isolated enviroment, 
### runned in a docker image using jupyter notebook and also ran it in a virtual enviroment created with python 3.9.+ , pyspark 3.1.+ , Java 8 and Jupyter. 
### Using Visual Studio Code. 

# Important!
### To make sure the project will run, only check in the beggin path of the sql file is setted. A dynamic path was created, but is important to make sure, this way everithing will run.
### sql file is located in: etc/jupyter/nbconfig/notebook.d/hubs_files/hubs_events.sql
### the script is a notebook file located in : etc/jupyter/nbconfig/notebook.d/hubs_files/hubs_events.ipynb


#You can also create a virtual enviroment an run the pip install requirements.txt then everything you need will be installed.
## As a advice I'm dropping a link explain how to create a venv folder to install all the dependences
